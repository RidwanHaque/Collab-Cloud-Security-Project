## 1. Introduction

The firewall is a critical component of the cybersecurity home lab, acting as a barrier between the internal network and external threats. This document outlines the necessary steps to configure the firewall effectively.

## 2. Firewall Configuration Steps

- **Step 1:** Access the firewall management interface.
- **Step 2:** Review the default settings and policies.
- **Step 3:** Define the network zones (e.g., internal, external).
- **Step 4:** Configure rules for inbound and outbound traffic.
- **Step 5:** Save and apply the configuration.

## 3. Common Firewall Rules

- Allow SSH (port 22) from trusted IP addresses.
- Block all incoming traffic by default.
- Allow HTTP (port 80) and HTTPS (port 443) for web services.
- Log all denied traffic for monitoring purposes.

## 4. Testing Firewall Configuration

After configuring the firewall, it is crucial to test the rules to ensure they are functioning as intended. Use tools like `ping`, `telnet`, or `nmap` to verify connectivity and rule enforcement.

## 5. Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the firewall configuration:
- Check the logs for denied connections.
- Ensure that the correct interfaces are configured.
- Review the order of rules, as they are processed top to bottom.
